# docker documentation

This is our docker documentation, covering all relevant docker features and workflows needed. Expect the docs to get filled as we advance with docker.

## Structure

**scripts**
Inside `scripts` you will find (bash) scripts used for running or managing docker containters, e.g. `vhost.sh` to create apache virtual host files as well as ssl certs and keys.

**container**
`container` holds documentations related to containers. The structure might change.
