# synoa's git workflow

## Getting started

The starting point for every project is the **master** branch. And the first thing to do is to create the initial commit directly into the **master** to set the code base for every other developer in the project.

### Steps

* Create the project on GitHub (e.g. https://github.com/synoa/git.workflow)
* Clone the project into your local machine 
  ```git clone git@github.com:synoa/git.workflow.git```
